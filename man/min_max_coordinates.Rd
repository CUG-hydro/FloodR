\title{Determine the minimal and maximal eastings and northings for a region and
the surrounding DWD-stations}
\usage{
min_max_coordinates(Station_list, Area, coordinates)
}
\arguments{
\item{Station_list}{A dataframe containing the relevant DWD-stations' IDs,
eastings, northings and heights. The Station-IDs must consist of 5 digits.
If the ID is shorter than that it must be filled with zeros as leading
digits. The column names must be "Stations_id", "Easting", "Northing" and
"Height".}

\item{Area}{A dataframe containing all subdomain's names, gridcodes and
heights. The column names must be "names", "gridcode" and "height".}

\item{coordinates}{A dataframe containing every subdomain's coordinates. The
column names must be "Easting_gridcode" and "Northing_gridcode" ("gridcode"
must be replaced with the actual gridcode). Missing values indicated by
NA-values are omitted during the procedure.}
}
\value{
\item{results}{A vector containing the minimal easting, the maximal
easting, the minimal northing and the maximal northing in this order.}
}
\description{
The coordinates of the subdomains of the specified region and the
coordinates of the relevant DWD-stations are read. The minimal and maximal
eastings and northings of all these coordinates are determined.
