\title{Apply the TMPS model to a set of data for a typewise statistical estimate of return periods
as well as a combined TMPS return period. See reference Fischer (2018)}
\usage{
TMPS_model(
  Flood_events,
  Daily_discharge,
  return_TMPS,
  Threshold_Q,
  p_input = NULL,
  q_input = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Flood_events}{data.frame: Floods events with the columns "Peak_date" (Date format), "HQ" (numeric) and "Type" (factor)}

\item{Daily_discharge}{data.frame: Daily discharge (continuous) with columns "Date (Date format) and "Discharge" (numeric)}

\item{return_TMPS}{character vector: What should be returned. Any combination of "TMPS" and the occuring floodtypes}

\item{Threshold_Q}{numeric: Peak of Threshold, defaults to 3}

\item{p_input}{The points (as years of return period) where the quantiles should be calculated}

\item{q_input}{Probabilities to calculate the quantiles for}
