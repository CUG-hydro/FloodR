\title{Apply the SMPS model to a set of data for a typewise statistical estimate of return periods
as well as a combined SMPS return period. See reference Fischer (2018)}
\usage{
SMPS_model(
  Flood_events,
  Daily_discharge,
  return_period = c(2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000),
  return_types = c("SMPS", "R1", "R2", "R3", "S1", "S2"),
  Threshold_Q = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Flood_events}{data.frame: Floods events with the columns "Peak_date" (Date format), "HQ" (numeric) and "Type" (factor)}

\item{Daily_discharge}{data.frame: Daily discharge (continuous) with columns "Date (Date format) and "Discharge" (numeric)}

\item{return_period}{The points (as years of return period) where the quantiles should be calculated}

\item{return_types}{character vector: What should be returned. Any combination of "SMPS" and the occuring floodtypes}

\item{Threshold_Q}{numeric: Peak of Threshold, defaults to 3}
}
