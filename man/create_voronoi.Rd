\title{Creation of Voronoi polygons based on DWD-stations}
\usage{
create_voronoi(
  stations,
  z,
  Days,
  Station_list,
  limits_voronoi,
  coordinates,
  YY,
  All_Days,
  Area
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stations}{A dataframe containing TRUE or FALSE values for every day
and every DWD-station. If the station has registered a value, there is a
"TRUE", otherwise there is a "FALSE".}

\item{z}{A number that indicates the timestep of the year considered. If the
data is interpolated for the years from 1900 to 2015, z <- 1 indicates the
year 1900.}

\item{Days}{An array containig the date of every day of the year considered.}

\item{Station_list}{A dataframe containing the relevant DWD-stations' IDs,
eastings, northings and heights. The Station-IDs must consist of 5 digits.
If the ID is shorter than that it must be filled with zeros as leading
digits. The column names must be "Stations_id", "Easting", "Northing" and
"Height".}

\item{limits_voronoi}{A vector containing the minimal and maximal eastings
and northings of the DWD-stations and the region in question.}

\item{coordinates}{A dataframe containing every subdomain's coordinates. The
column names must be "Easting_gridcode" and "Northing_gridcode" ("gridcode"
must be replaced with the actual gridcode). Missing values indicated by
NA-values are omitted during the procedure.}

\item{YY}{An array containing all considered years.}

\item{All_Days}{A sequence containing the date for every day within the
period for which the Voronoi polygons are created.The days' format must be
"Y-m-d".}

\item{Area}{A dataframe containing all subdomain's names, gridcodes and
heights. The column names must be "names", "gridcode" and "height".}
}
\value{
A list with the following entries: \item{names_over_all_days}{A list
containing as many dataframes as there are subdomains. Every dataframe
contains the relevant DWD-stations for the considered subdomain and the year
in question.} \item{D}{A three-dimensional array containing every
DWD-station's share for every day and every subdomain.
}
}
\description{
For the region in question, Voronoi polygons are created based on
coordinates of DWD-stations in and surrounding the region. For every day,
they are created anew to consider every change in data availability.
